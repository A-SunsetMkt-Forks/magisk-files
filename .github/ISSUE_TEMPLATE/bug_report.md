## READ BEFORE OPENING ISSUES

Only accept bugreports that are happened on Kitsune Magisk only

All bug reports require you to **USE DEBUG BUILDS**. Please include the version name and version code in the bug report.

If you experience a bootloop, attach a `dmesg` (kernel logs) when the device refuse to boot. This may very likely require a custom kernel on some devices as `last_kmsg` or `pstore ramoops` are usually not enabled by default. In addition, please also upload the result of `cat /proc/mounts` when your device is working correctly **WITHOUT MAGISK**.

**DO NOT** ask for instructions.

**DO NOT** report issues if you have any modules installed.

Without following the rules above, your issue will be closed without explanation.
